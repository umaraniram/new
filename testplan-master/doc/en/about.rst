Testplan was originally developed by developers for developers to test software.
It was created inside Morgan Stanley by a small dev team out of their own need
to test internal C++ infrastructure libraries. It has since grown to become
widely used for all manner of system testing needs, and we're now very proud to
see it released as open source.

We would like to make a special acknowledgment to Amaury C, Adam C, Francois V.
and Oliver M. for their pioneering work and contribution!
